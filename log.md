# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 24, 2020, Tuesday 
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned printing, commmenting, debugging, string manipulation, and variables in Python.

**Thoughts:** With experience in other languages, I found these beginner tasks easy. Python is a nice language to work with. It's very similar to Ruby with it's simplicity in syntax. 

**Link to work:** [Band Name Generator](projects/band_name_generator.py)

### Day 2: November 25, 2020, Wednesday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned data types, numbers, operations, type conversion, and f-Strings.

**Thoughts**: I do really like the simplicity of Python syntax. Looking forward to building more complex applications but starting off slow to build up to the more complex while learning the language.

### Day 3: November 26, 2020, Thursday (Thanksgiving üá∫üá∏ü¶É)
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned conditional statements, logical operators, code blocks, and scope.

**Thoughts**: Still learning the basics and getting reacclimated to programming logic. Found this to be a fun simple project day.

5. [Love Calculator](projects/love_calculator.py)
6. [Choose Your Own Adventure Game](projects/choose_your_own_adventure_game.py)

### Day 4: November 27, Friday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned randomisation, using the random module, and lists.

**Thoughts:** I've recently got back into coding and I'm finding it easy to pick up a new language especially one as nice as Python. Enjoyed creating, though simple, the Rock Paper Scissors game.

1. [Rock Paper Scissors](projects/rock_paper_scissors.py)

### Day 5: November 28, Saturday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress:** Learned for loops, range, and code blocks.

**Thoughts:** Though the day involves using for loops, the password generator was created using Python functions that bypassed using loops. Will go back to solve without using handy functions.

2. [Highest Score](projects/highest_score.py)
3. [Adding Evens](projects/adding_evens.py)
4. [FizzBuzz](projects/fizzbuzz.py)
5. [Password Generator](projects/password_generator.py)

### Day 6: November 29, Sunday üèà
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned functions, code blocks, and while loops.

**Thoughts:** Enjoyed working through the online Python coding game, Reeborg's World, to practice creating and calling functions, using while loops, and if/else statements.

**Link(s) to work:**
[Reeborg's World - Maze](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html)

```
def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()

while front_is_clear():
    move()
turn_left()
    
while not at_goal():
    if right_is_clear():
        turn_right()
        move()
    elif front_is_clear():
        move()
    else:
        turn_left()
```
### Day 7: November 30, Monday ‚òîÔ∏è
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with for and while loops, if/else statements, lists, strings, range, and modules.

**Thoughts:** Adding what I previously learned to create a hangman game.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Hangman](projects/hangman/main.py)

### Day 8: December 1, Tuesday ‚ùÑÔ∏è
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with for and while loops, if/else statements, lists, strings, range, and modules. Learned functions with inputs (arguments and parameters).

**Thoughts:** Adding additonal features to the hangman game including the hangman itself.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Hangman](projects/hangman/main.py)

### Day 9: December 2, Wednesday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Continued with functions with inputs (arguments and parameters).
**Thoughts:** Found this to be the most challenging when it came to letters at the end of the alphabet in Caeser Cipher. Adding an additional alphabet solved that problem. Will refactor to accomodate invalid inputs.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Paint Area Calculator](projects/area_calc.py)
2. [Prime Number Checker](projects/prime_number_checker.py)
3. [Caeser Cipher](projects/caeser_cipher/main.py)

### Day 10: December 3, Thursday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Caeser Cipher project. Refactored and included additional functions.

**Thoughts:** Enjoyed creating the project. Project was challenging. Stacking and implementing previous learnings helps in solidifying knowledge.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Caeser Cipher](projects/caeser_cipher/main.py)

### Day 11: December 4, Friday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned dictionaries and nesting. Started coding project, Silent Auction

**Thoughts:** While the concepts are still relatively simple, remembering "dictionary" rather than "list" is something to get used to.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Silent Auction](projects/silent_auction/main.py)

### Day 12: December 5, Saturday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Silent Auction project.

**Thoughts:** Worked way to long on a bug that involved a simple fix of indentation.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Silent Auction](projects/silent_auction/main.py)

### Day 13: December 6, Sunday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned functions with outputs. Created and finished a calculator app and started new project, Blackjack.

**Thoughts:** Indentation and adding colons seems to be a theme with my bugs. Understanding the meaning of errors has improved over the last several days.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Number of Days in a Month](algorithms/leap_year.py)
2. [Calculator](projects/calculator/main.py)
3. [Blackjack](projects/blackjack/main.py)

### Day 14: December 7, Monday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Blackjack game. Added workflow comments for each of the functions in the game.

**Thoughts:** Working out the flow and each function of the game seems to be the most time consuming. Not sure if flowcharts are better or just typing out the thought process. Leaning towards just typing out the flow (pseudo code). Creating the flowchart is more time consuming from just getting the arrows right (dealing with the software on draw.io).

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Blackjack](projects/blackjack/main.py)

### Day 15: December 8, Tuesday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Blackjack game. 

**Thoughts:** It took longer than I expected to finish writing the code. Found it super helpful though to first write the pseudocode and then code out each function to complete the game.
