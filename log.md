# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 24, 2020, Tuesday 
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned printing, commmenting, debugging, string manipulation, and variables in Python.

**Thoughts:** With experience in other languages, I found these beginner tasks easy. Python is a nice language to work with. It's very similar to Ruby with it's simplicity in syntax. 

**Link to work:** [Band Name Generator](projects/band_name_generator.py)

### Day 2: November 25, 2020, Wednesday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned data types, numbers, operations, type conversion, and f-Strings.

**Thoughts**: I do really like the simplicity of Python syntax. Looking forward to building more complex applications but starting off slow to build up to the more complex while learning the language.

```
def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()

while front_is_clear():
    move()
turn_left()
    
while not at_goal():
    if right_is_clear():
        turn_right()
        move()
    elif front_is_clear():
        move()
    else:
        turn_left()
```
### Day 7: November 30, Monday ‚òîÔ∏è
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with for and while loops, if/else statements, lists, strings, range, and modules.

**Thoughts:** Adding what I previously learned to create a hangman game.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Hangman](projects/hangman/main.py)

### Day 8: December 1, Tuesday ‚ùÑÔ∏è
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with for and while loops, if/else statements, lists, strings, range, and modules. Learned functions with inputs (arguments and parameters).

**Thoughts:** Adding additonal features to the hangman game including the hangman itself.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Hangman](projects/hangman/main.py)

### Day 9: December 2, Wednesday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Continued with functions with inputs (arguments and parameters).
**Thoughts:** Found this to be the most challenging when it came to letters at the end of the alphabet in Caeser Cipher. Adding an additional alphabet solved that problem. Will refactor to accomodate invalid inputs.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Paint Area Calculator](projects/area_calc.py)
2. [Prime Number Checker](projects/prime_number_checker.py)
3. [Caeser Cipher](projects/caeser_cipher/main.py)

### Day 10: December 3, Thursday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Caeser Cipher project. Refactored and included additional functions.

**Thoughts:** Enjoyed creating the project. Project was challenging. Stacking and implementing previous learnings helps in solidifying knowledge.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Caeser Cipher](projects/caeser_cipher/main.py)

### Day 11: December 4, Friday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned dictionaries and nesting. Started coding project, Silent Auction

**Thoughts:** While the concepts are still relatively simple, remembering "dictionary" rather than "list" is something to get used to.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Silent Auction](projects/silent_auction/main.py)

### Day 12: December 5, Saturday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Silent Auction project.

**Thoughts:** Worked way to long on a bug that involved a simple fix of indentation.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Silent Auction](projects/silent_auction/main.py)

### Day 13: December 6, Sunday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned functions with outputs. Created and finished a calculator app and started new project, Blackjack.

**Thoughts:** Indentation and adding colons seems to be a theme with my bugs. Understanding the meaning of errors has improved over the last several days.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Number of Days in a Month](algorithms/leap_year.py)
2. [Calculator](projects/calculator/main.py)
3. [Blackjack](projects/blackjack/main.py)

### Day 14: December 7, Monday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Blackjack game. Added workflow comments for each of the functions in the game.

**Thoughts:** Working out the flow and each function of the game seems to be the most time consuming. Not sure if flowcharts are better or just typing out the thought process. Leaning towards just typing out the flow (pseudo code). Creating the flowchart is more time consuming from just getting the arrows right (dealing with the software on draw.io).

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Blackjack](projects/blackjack/main.py)

### Day 15: December 8, Tuesday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Blackjack game. 

**Thoughts:** It took longer than I expected to finish writing the code. Found it super helpful though to first write the pseudocode and then code out each function to complete the game.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Blackjack](projects/blackjack/main.py)

### Day 16: December 9, Wednesday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned namespaces and scope and local vs global variables.
Started a new project, Number Guessing Game

**Thoughts:** Finding that ':' is still a common bug issue for me when writing Python code. Just something to get used to and will eventually become second nature when writing functions and other statements involving ':'

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Number Guessing Game](projects/number_guessing/main.py)

### Day 17: December 10, Thursday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned about debugging in Python and how to better find and fix errors in my code by describing the problem and testing assumptions. The handy print() and a debugger are also great tools.

**Thoughts:** I have to say, using the debugger tool at [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/) is fabulous! This is the single best tool to visualize what each line of code is doing to easily help find bugs AND to also get a better understanding of programming concepts and how code actually works. Love this so much.

### Day 18: December 11, Friday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Starting a new project, Higher Lower Game based on the game here, [The Higher Lower Game](http://www.higherlowergame.com/). Compare and guess which of two choices has a higher Instagram following. Guess wrong, you lose but guess right and you continue with the next comparison.

**Thoughts:** Practicing building a project from idea to planning to code using the knowledge I've built up to this point. Planning is definitely the most challenging aspect.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Higher Lower Game](projects/higher_lower/main.py)

### Day 19: December 12, Saturday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Continued building project, Higher Lower Game based on the game here, [The Higher Lower Game](http://www.higherlowergame.com/). Compare and guess which of two choices has a higher Instagram following. Guess wrong, you lose but guess right and you continue with the next comparison.

**Thoughts:** Probably spent way more time building this than it should have taken. Got hung up with clearing the screen at the start of the game but left code as is. It's a minor detail. May revisit later.

1. [Higher Lower Game](projects/higher_lower/main.py)

### Day 20: December 13, Sunday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: You know those coffee vending machines you've probably seen at one of your old jobs with the watered down, not very tasty coffee? Well, that's the project I've started today, a command line coffee machine.

**Thoughts:** It seems easy until everything breaks or doesn't work like you thought it would. Becoming a master at resolving bugs is a super power.

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Coffee Machine](projects/coffee_machine/main.py)

### Day 21: December 14, Monday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Coffee Machine project.

**Thoughts:** It gets easier the more I code out the projects though not easy enought to get the code 'perfect' the first time around. Does anyone?

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Coffee Machine](projects/coffee_machine/main.py)

### Day 22: December 15, Tuesday
##### *Python Intermediate*

**Today's Progress**: Learned Object Oriented Programming(OOP) in Python: class, objects, attributes, and methods. Also worked with libraries, ex. Turtle, and Python packages via PyPi

**Thoughts:** The Turtle library had all kinds of errors and I have no idea why. A bit frustrating but moved on. Trying to use pretty table but getting an error in VSCode that states "Unable to import 'prettytable' and, at the moment, can't figure out why even though I confirmed it's installed üò°

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Turtle Graphics](projects/turtle_graphics/main.py)

### Day 23: December 16, Wednesday
##### *Python Intermediate*

**Today's Progress**: Spent the day debugging the import error for PyPi packages. 

**Thoughts:** It definitely seems to be a VSCode issue because the packages are installed, confirmed via pip3 list, and the code runs as long as I use python3 but the error still exists per the Pylance message stating "MissingImports". Searching through the internets has not yet resolved the issue. Another option is to go through this whole section on Python in VSCode to hopefully resolve it [Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)

**Link(s) to work:**

### Day 24: December 17, Thursday
##### *Python Intermediate*

**Today's Progress**: Practice with imports and using packages from PyPi. Converted Coffee Machine project to OOP but using imports from premade files to create the coffee machine.

**Thoughts:** The import error was getting tiresome so after more Googling, I discovered that I can just turn off the error messaging for Pylance in json.settings. Done. Much happier now.

2. [OOP Coffee Machine](projects/oop_coffee_machine)

### Day 25: December 18, Friday
##### *Python Intermediate*

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to create classes in Python. Created a true/false quiz game using these concepts.

**Thoughts:** Having fun keeping track and creating models with functionality to create the program. All jokes aside, this was a little more difficult to manage but more practice will make this easier. 

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Quiz](projects/quiz/main.py)

### Day 26: December 19, Saturday
##### *Python Intermediate*

**Today's Progress**: Finished Quiz project.

**Thoughts:** Definitely need more practice creating projects using OOP concepts.

1. [Reverse a String](algorithms/reverse_string.py)
2. [List Check](algorithms/list_check.py)

### Day 28: December 21, Monday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Spent the day again reviewing the basics of Python and the different built-in functions and methods that I didn't previously cover including dictionary methods, tuples, and sets, and short circuit evaluation. Also worked through basic algorithm challenges.

**Thoughts:** Was thinking this would be a another good day to review to solidify the concepts. 

**Link(s) to work:**
1. [Remove Every Other](algorithms/remove_every_other.py)

### Day 29: December 22, Tuesday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned about the enumerate function, *args, **kwargs, scope, the walrus operator and clean code. Practiced more algorithm challenges.

**Thoughts:** Good idea to think about how my code can be 'cleaner' and more readable moving forward.
