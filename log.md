# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 24, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned printing, commmenting, debugging, string manipulation, and variables in Python.

**Thoughts:** With experience in other languages, I found these beginner tasks easy. Python is a nice language to work with. It's very similar to Ruby with it's simplicity in syntax.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
