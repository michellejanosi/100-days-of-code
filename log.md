# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 24, 2020, Tuesday 
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned printing, commmenting, debugging, string manipulation, and variables in Python.

**Thoughts:** With experience in other languages, I found these beginner tasks easy. Python is a nice language to work with. It's very similar to Ruby with it's simplicity in syntax.

##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned data types, numbers, operations, type conversion, and f-Strings.

**Thoughts**: I do really like the simplicity of Python syntax. Looking forward to building more complex applications but starting off slow to build up to the more complex while learning the language.
