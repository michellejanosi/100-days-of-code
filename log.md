# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 24, 2020, Tuesday 
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned printing, commmenting, debugging, string manipulation, and variables in Python.

**Thoughts:** With experience in other languages, I found these beginner tasks easy. Python is a nice language to work with. It's very similar to Ruby with it's simplicity in syntax.

### Day 2: November 25, 2020, Wednesday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned data types, numbers, operations, type conversion, and f-Strings.

**Thoughts**: I do really like the simplicity of Python syntax. Looking forward to building more complex applications but starting off slow to build up to the more complex while learning the language.

### Day 3: November 26, 2020, Thursday (Thanksgiving üá∫üá∏ü¶É)
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned conditional statements, logical operators, code blocks, and scope.

**Thoughts**: Still learning the basics and getting reacclimated to programming logic. Found this to be a fun simple project day.

2. [BMI Calculator](projects/bmi_calculator.py)
3. [Leap Year](projects/leap_year.py)
4. [Pizza Order](projects/pizza_order.py)
5. [Love Calculator](projects/love_calculator.py)
6. [Choose Your Own Adventure Game](projects/choose_your_own_adventure_game.py)

### Day 4: November 27, Friday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned randomisation, using the random module, and lists.

**Thoughts:** I've recently got back into coding and I'm finding it easy to pick up a new language especially one as nice as Python. Enjoyed creating, though simple, the Rock Paper Scissors game.

1. [Rock Paper Scissors](projects/rock_paper_scissors.py)

### Day 5: November 28, Saturday
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress:** Learned for loops, range, and code blocks.

**Thoughts:** Though the day involves using for loops, the password generator was created using Python functions that bypassed using loops. Will go back to solve without using handy functions.

1. [Average Height](projects/average_height.py)
2. [Highest Score](projects/highest_score.py)
3. [Adding Evens](projects/adding_evens.py)
4. [FizzBuzz](projects/fizzbuzz.py)
5. [Password Generator](projects/password_generator.py)

### Day 6: November 29, Sunday üèà
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: Learned functions, code blocks, and while loops.

**Thoughts:** Enjoyed working through the online Python coding game, Reeborg's World, to practice creating and calling functions, using while loops, and if/else statements.

```def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()

while front_is_clear():
    move()
turn_left()
    
while not at_goal():
    if right_is_clear():
        turn_right()
        move()
    elif front_is_clear():
        move()
    else:
        turn_left()
```

<!-- ### Day 3: November 26, Thursday (Thanksgiving)
##### *Python Basics*

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
