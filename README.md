## 📃 Rules

Here are the main rules I'm adhering to throughout the challenge:

1. **Code Daily**: I commit to coding for at least one hour every day for the next 100 days.

2. **Share Progress**: I will share my progress every day on [Twitter](#https://twitter.com/michellejanosi) using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.

3. **Work on Real Projects**: The majority of my time will be spent working on real projects, facing and solving real problems.

4. **Jot Down Learnings**: I commit to documenting my journey, learnings, and insights in the [log](#log.md). This is to keep a record of my thoughts and processes as I overcome challenges and develop solutions.

5. **Help and Encourage Others**: I'll try to help other people who are also doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge by giving them feedback, encouraging them, and sharing my own experiences.

6. **Resource Utilization**: I'll use a mix of resources (books, online tutorials, coding platforms) to learn new concepts and apply them. All notable resources will be shared in the [resources](#resources.md) section.

7. **Reflection and Iteration**: Reflecting on what's working and what's not is key. I will strive to iterate on my approach based on these reflections to optimize my learning.
